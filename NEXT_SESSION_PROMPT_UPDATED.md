## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED IN CURRENT SESSION**

### **üêõ "Search by Distance" Bug - FIXED ‚úÖ**
- **Issue**: Discover dishes page showing empty results despite search filters being set

## üö® **NEXT PRIORITY: REMAINING HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ITEMS**

Based on `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_CHECKLIST.md`, there are **2 HIGH PRIORITY** security vulnerabilities remaining:

### **üö® HIGH PRIORITY (Next Session Focus):**

1. **Authorization Security - Admin Bypass (HIGH)**
   - **File**: `src/hooks/useDishes.tsx` (lines 414-424)
   - **Issue**: Admin checks performed client-side, can be bypassed via dev tools manipulation
   - **Risk**: Non-admin users can potentially delete dishes by manipulating client-side code
   - **Action**: Create server-side edge function for admin operations
   - **Goal**: Move dish deletion authorization to server-side with proper admin verification

2. **SQL Injection Prevention (HIGH)**
   - **File**: `src/hooks/useRestaurants.tsx` (line 99)
   - **Issue**: Raw user input in database queries using string interpolation
   - **Risk**: Potential SQL injection attacks through search functionality
   - **Action**: Replace string interpolation with parameterized queries
   - **Goal**: Prevent SQL injection attacks through proper query sanitization

### **üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY (Consider if Time):**

3. **Input Validation Enhancement**
   - Add comprehensive validation for all user inputs
   - Implement length limits for text fields
   - Validate UUID formats for IDs

4. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Implement per-user rate limiting on edge functions
   - Add per-IP rate limiting
   - Create rate limiting middleware

## üìã **RECOMMENDED SESSION APPROACH**

### **Phase 1: Admin Authorization Fix (45-60 min)**

1. **Analyze Current Admin Logic**:
   - Review `src/hooks/useDishes.tsx` admin check implementation (lines 414-424)
   - Identify all admin-only operations (dish deletion, restaurant management)
   - Document current client-side admin verification flow

2. **Create Admin Edge Function**:
   - Create `supabase/functions/admin-operations/index.ts`
   - Implement server-side admin verification using Supabase auth
   - Move dish deletion logic to server-side with proper authorization
   - Add comprehensive input validation and error handling

3. **Update Client Code**:
   - Remove client-side admin checks from `useDishes.tsx`
   - Update admin operations to use new edge function
   - Implement proper error handling for authorization failures
   - Test with admin and non-admin users

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Test admin operations with admin user (should work)
   - Test admin operations with regular user (should fail with 403)
   - Test admin operations without authentication (should fail with 401)
   - Verify client-side manipulation cannot bypass server checks

### **Phase 2: SQL Injection Prevention (30-45 min)**

1. **Review Current Query Construction**:
   - Examine `src/hooks/useRestaurants.tsx` line 99
   - Identify other locations with dynamic query building
   - Document current string interpolation usage

2. **Implement Parameterized Queries**:
   - Replace string interpolation with Supabase's built-in parameter binding
   - Add input sanitization for search terms and special characters
   - Implement proper escaping for user-provided data
   - Update all similar query patterns across the codebase

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Test search with normal terms (should work normally)
   - Test search with SQL injection payloads (should be safely handled)
   - Test restaurant name search with special characters
   - Verify no database errors with malicious inputs

### **Phase 3: Input Validation (if time allows)**

1. **Create Validation Utilities**:
   - Create `src/utils/validation.ts`
   - Implement UUID validation, length checks, format validation
   - Add comprehensive input sanitization functions

2. **Apply Validation**:
   - Add validation to form inputs across the application
   - Validate API parameters in edge functions
   - Implement consistent error messaging

## üîç **TESTING CHECKLIST FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **Admin Authorization Tests:**
- [ ] Test admin operations with admin user (should work)
- [ ] Test admin operations with regular user (should fail with 403)
- [ ] Test admin operations without authentication (should fail with 401)
- [ ] Test client-side admin flag manipulation (should still fail on server)
- [ ] Verify dish deletion only works for actual admin users

### **SQL Injection Tests:**
- [ ] Test search with normal terms (should work)
- [ ] Test search with SQL injection payloads like `'; DROP TABLE--` (should be safe)
- [ ] Test restaurant name search with special characters `@#$%^&*()`
- [ ] Test with malformed queries and verify proper error handling
- [ ] Verify no sensitive database information leaks in error messages

### **Input Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Test form inputs with overly long strings
- [ ] Test UUID fields with malformed IDs
- [ ] Test file uploads with invalid formats (if applicable)
- [ ] Test numeric fields with non-numeric input

## üìÅ **KEY FILES TO WORK WITH**

### **Current Security Issues:**
- `src/hooks/useDishes.tsx` - Admin authorization bypass (lines 414-424)
- `src/hooks/useRestaurants.tsx` - SQL injection risk (line 99)

### **Files to Create:**
- `supabase/functions/admin-operations/index.ts` - Server-side admin operations
- `src/utils/validation.ts` - Input validation utilities (if time allows)

### **Files to Test:**

- Search functionality (restaurant search, dish search)
- Any forms with user input

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR NEXT SESSION**

By the end of the next session:
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: Admin authorization moved to server-side with proper verification
- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY**: SQL injection vulnerabilities eliminated with parameterized queries

- [ ] Security remediation checklist updated

## üîß **QUICK START COMMANDS**

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Check TypeScript
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Test admin operations (after implementing server-side function)
# Navigate to admin sections and test dish deletion with different user roles

# Test SQL injection resistance
# Try entering malicious payloads in search fields
```

## üìù **IMPORTANT CONTEXT**

### **Current Security Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Critical vulnerabilities**: All resolved
- ‚úÖ **App functionality**: Fully working (including search by distance)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High priority items**: 2 remaining (admin bypass, SQL injection)
- üîß **Medium priority items**: Several remaining (see checklist)

### **Authentication Setup:**
- JWT tokens working properly
- Edge functions secured with authentication
- Session management functional

### **Database Schema:**
- Supabase PostgreSQL database
- Row Level Security (RLS) not yet implemented (planned for future)
- Direct database queries through Supabase client

### **Admin Functionality:**
- Current admin check is client-side only (VULNERABILITY)
- Admin operations include dish deletion, restaurant management
- Need to implement server-side admin verification

---

**Session Focus**: Fix the remaining HIGH PRIORITY security vulnerabilities - admin authorization bypass and SQL injection prevention. These are the last high-priority security items before moving to medium-priority enhancements.

**Remember**: The app core functionality is working perfectly (search, photos, auth, distance filtering all fixed), but we need to secure the admin operations and database queries before considering the security remediation complete!
