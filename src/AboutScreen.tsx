            HowzEverything started from a simple, universal question: "What should I order?" We've all been thereâ€”staring at a long menu, overwhelmed by options, wishing we had a trusted friend's recommendation. This app is that friend.

            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our mission is to end "menu anxiety" and help people make better dining decisions by focusing on what matters most: the food itself. While restaurant reviews are helpful, the quality of individual dishes can vary wildly. We empower a community of food lovers to rate and discover specific dishes, creating a global, dish-level guide to the world's best food.
          </p>

              <strong>Search First:</strong> Find your restaurant and search for the dish you tried. This collaborative approach prevents duplicates and aggregates ratings effectively.
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: SPACING[3] }}>
              <strong>Rate Your Dish:</strong> Give the dish a star rating from 1 to 5. Was it a culinary masterpiece or blech? Your rating helps everyone (especially you, next time). You can add a photo and a comment too.
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginBottom: SPACING[3] }}>
              <strong>Discover with Confidence:</strong> Use the Discover screen to find the best-rated dishes near you. Filter by rating, distance, and cuisine to find exactly what you're craving.
