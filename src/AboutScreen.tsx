            HowzEverything started from a simple, universal question: "What should I order?" We've all been thereâ€”staring at a long menu, overwhelmed by options, wishing we had a trusted friend's recommendation. <strong>This app is that friend.</strong>

            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hate wasting money on lousy food? Us too! Our mission is to end "menu anxiety" and help people make better dining decisions by focusing on what matters most: the food itself. While restaurant reviews are helpful, the quality of individual dishes can vary wildly. We empower a community of food lovers to rate and discover specific dishes, creating a global, dish-level guide to restaurant food.
          </p>
